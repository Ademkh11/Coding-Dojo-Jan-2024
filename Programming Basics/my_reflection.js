/*1) First, answer: how have you noticed your bootcamp knowledge grow or change during Programming Basics?
After my first week in coding dojo i learned valuble things about programming languages especially about java script like it's basics and what i need to
 do in order to continue my learning in this field thanks to practice exercises in the platform and also the instuctors.
Maybe my knowledge didn't grow alot but i know that i can make it happen if i trust in the process and focus on improving my programming skills.


2) Then, answer: how have you noticed your approach to learning change throughout Programming Basics?
my idea of learning has changed after i've read through the content offred by the platform, i realised that i shouldn't worry about getting things right
 as much as i should worry about how i can really learn.
 Means that i shouldn't work only to get the exercise done and pass it but i should give my full time to really learn and get the
 benefit of it.
Also i think that most importantly i must master the logic of programming so i can solve different problems .

3) what do you consider your "Mistake of the Week," which was a valuable failure you learned from during Programming Basics?
I think that my "Mistake of the week " was that when i don't understand a specific exercise i tend to search about the answer without giving it enough 
time to struggle in it, maybe at some situations i didn't go by the role of 20 minutes because i didn't have much patience. Know that i've known my
mistake i will try to work on avoiding it in the future and just go by the instructions given by TA's , instructors and also by the platform./*
